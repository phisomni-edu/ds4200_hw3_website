            <p>
                In an increasingly digitized world, much of our finances and management are done online. As a result, attacks on personal such as 
                phishing become ever common, with there being over 500 million attacks in 2022 alone, according to Forbes. During March and April of 
                2024, I along with a peer conducted an investigation on phishing URLs to determine what features distinguished attacks from 
                legitimate links, and to see whether a standard machine learning model could consistently tell the difference. After performing 
                feature engineering, data analysis, modeling, tuning, and validation, we found that the best predictors of whether a URL was 
                phishing was its length and the number of slash (/) characters it contained. Additionally, we were able to create models that had 
                recall and f1 scores of around 80%, which we deemed successful as a proof of concept.

                My name is Aran Dharma, and I am currently a second year candidate for a Bachelor's in Data Science from Northeastern University in 
                Boston. I love working with data, whether it be extracting it, analyzing it or modeling it. I am especially fascinated with the 
                sophisticated means of machine comprehension of data, and am currently learning neural networks, which I plan on applying to some 
                of my previous projects, such as this one.
