                Here is the process we undertook to complete our analysis.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We first sourced the data from Mendeley, and had to combine two different data files together over compatible columns. We then
                selected for columns thatw were the most relevent, and performed other data cleanup sets.</li>
                <li>We then tested a large variety of classifier models on a small portion of the data, and plotted their respective accuracy, 
                precision, and recall. We decided to move on with KNN and Random Forests for their performance.</li>
                <li>We then tested various parameters for the models, performing KFlold Cross Validation ech time to find the best K and branch
                depth for the respective models, settling on 9 and 7 respectively.</li>
                <li>We trained the models with optimized parameters on the whole data with KFold Cross Validation, and created confusion heatmaps
                based on the classification results.</li>
                <li>We used the point biserial tests to get the correlstion between individual variables and phishing status, finding the number of
                forward slashes and the URL length to be the strongest correlated.</li>
                <li>We performed some exploratory data analysis to try and identify and other trends within the data, focusing on the features
                we saw strongly and moderately correlated to phishing.</li>
